# codetocloud

Everything in this repo is currently private. I am also planning to break the code into separate repos, but while we are finalizing this is an easier path for making edits and updates across the codebases. 

workflow.sh has set up steps to get the frontend + one of the backends running in ACA. I have tested all of them and they should all work. 

updated gist for quickstart: https://gist.github.com/kendallroden/391a0fb9a67c943902f8c2b49418f152
(thanks anthony for collaborating on that) 

I'll update the second and third gists related to the follow up tutorials, as we have the UI for the follow up and the environment variable can be updated to showcase traffic splitting.
